/**
 * @title Flywheel Core Incentives Manager
 *  @notice Flywheel is a general framework for managing token incentives.
 *          It takes reward streams to various *strategies* such as staking LP tokens
 *          and divides them among *users* of those strategies.
 *
 *          The Core contract maintains three important pieces of state:
 *           - the rewards index which determines how many rewards are owed per token per strategy.
 *           - User indexes track how far behind the strategy they are to lazily calculate all catch-up rewards.
 *           - the accrued (unclaimed) rewards per user.
 *           - references to the booster and rewards module described below.
 *
 *          Core does not manage any tokens directly. The rewards module maintains token balances,
 *          and approves core to pull transfer them to users when they claim.
 *
 *          SECURITY NOTE: For maximum accuracy and to avoid exploits:
 *          Rewards accrual should be notified atomically through the accrue hook.
 *          Accrue should be called any time tokens are transferred, minted, or burned.
